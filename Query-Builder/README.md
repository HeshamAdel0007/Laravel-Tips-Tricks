## 📚 What is Query Builder?

Laravel's **Query Builder** is a powerful tool for constructing SQL queries in a fluent and expressive manner. Instead of writing raw SQL, you can use the Query Builder to build queries dynamically and retrieve database records. It supports a wide range of query operations, such as:

- Select, Insert, Update, and Delete operations
- Where, Like, and Condition clauses
- Joins, Unions, and Grouping
- Aggregations and Ordering

### Key Features of Query Builder:
- **Fluent Interface**: Easily chain multiple query methods together.
- **Security**: Automatically escapes data to prevent SQL injection.
- **Eloquent Integration**: You can switch between Query Builder and Eloquent models as needed.
