# 🎯 Selecting Specific Attributes with `find()` in Laravel

When working with Eloquent in Laravel, the `find()` method is a convenient way to retrieve a model by its primary key. But what if you only want to select **specific columns** instead of loading the entire row? This guide shows how to do exactly that.

---

## Basic Usage of `find()`

```php
$user = User::find(1);

//- This will retrieve all columns from the users table for the row with id = 1

```

### Problem: How to select only certain columns

- The find() method does not support selecting specific columns directly like this:
  
```php
// ❌ This will not work
$user = User::find(1, ['id', 'name']);

//- This will still return all columns, or may even throw unexpected behavior depending on Laravel version.

```

### Recommended Solutions

1. Option 1: Use where() with first() and select()
```php
$user = User::select('id', 'name')
            ->where('id', 1)
            ->first();

//- This gives you the exact same result as find(1), but with only the selected columns
```

2. Option 2: Use findOrFail() alternative with select()
```php

$user = User::select('id', 'name')
            ->findOrFail(1); // ❌ Doesn't work as expected

//- ⚠️ findOrFail() also doesn't support custom columns directly. So instead, use:

$user = User::select('id', 'name')
            ->where('id', 1)
            ->firstOrFail();

```

### Why Not Use find() with Select?

- Because find() is a shortcut for:

```php
Model::where($primaryKey, $id)->first();
//- It does not allow chaining before execution — once you call find(), it immediately runs the query.
```

## Best Practice
- If you need to limit selected attributes, avoid using find() directly. Use where() + select() + first() or firstOrFail() instead.
