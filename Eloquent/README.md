## üìö What is Eloquent ORM?

Eloquent ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) is Laravel's built-in database query builder and ActiveRecord implementation. It makes interacting with your database tables easy by representing them as model classes. Eloquent provides a range of functions that help you retrieve, insert, update, and delete records effortlessly while also offering powerful features like relationships, scopes, and more.

## Key Features of Eloquent ORM:

- **ActiveRecord Implementation**: Each Eloquent model corresponds to a single database table, with the model's properties mapping to the table's columns.
- **Query Building**: Provides an expressive, fluent interface to build complex queries.
- **Relationships**: Easily define relationships between tables (e.g., one-to-many, many-to-many, etc.).
- **Mass Assignment Protection**: Protect against mass-assignment vulnerabilities by defining which fields are fillable.
