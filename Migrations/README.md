## 📌 What Are Migrations?

In Laravel, **migrations** are like version control for your database. They allow you to define the structure of your database tables in PHP code rather than manually creating them with SQL. This makes it easy to maintain consistency across different environments (local, staging, production) and collaborate with other developers.
